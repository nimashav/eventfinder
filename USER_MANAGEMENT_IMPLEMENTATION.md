# User Management System Implementation

## Overview
The hard-coded user management section has been completely replaced with a dynamic, backend-driven user management system. The system now supports full CRUD operations for user management with proper admin controls.

## Backend Implementation

### New API Endpoints Added

1. **DELETE /api/auth/users/:userId**
   - Delete a user (Admin only)
   - Prevents admins from deleting themselves
   - Returns success message on completion

2. **POST /api/auth/admin/create-user**
   - Create a new user (Admin only)
   - Supports creating both regular users and admins
   - Validates input and prevents duplicate emails

3. **GET /api/auth/admin/user-stats**
   - Get comprehensive user statistics
   - Returns total users, active users, admin count, new registrations
   - Includes recent user activity data

4. **GET /api/auth/admin/users/export**
   - Export all user data in CSV format
   - Returns formatted data ready for CSV download

### Enhanced Existing Endpoints

1. **GET /api/auth/users** (Enhanced)
   - Added search functionality (by name and email)
   - Added role filtering (admin/user)
   - Added status filtering (active/inactive)
   - Improved pagination with better metadata

## Frontend Implementation

### New Components Created

1. **UserModal** (`/components/UserModal/`)
   - Modal for adding new users
   - Form validation and error handling
   - Support for both user and admin creation
   - Responsive design

2. **ConfirmModal** (`/components/ConfirmModal/`)
   - Confirmation dialog for destructive actions
   - Reusable component for delete confirmations
   - Loading states during operations

### Updated Components

1. **UserManagement** (`/pages/Admin/UserManagement.jsx`)
   - Completely rewritten to use real API data
   - Real-time statistics from backend
   - Interactive user table with live actions
   - Search and filtering capabilities
   - Pagination support
   - Export functionality
   - Error handling and loading states

## Key Features Implemented

### Security Features
- ✅ **Admin Protection**: Admins cannot delete themselves

## Technical Details

### API Configuration
- Added proxy configuration in `vite.config.js` for API calls
- All API calls go through `/api/*` and are proxied to `http://localhost:5002`

### State Management
- Uses React hooks for local state management
- Automatic data refresh after operations
- Optimistic UI updates where appropriate

### Styling
- Enhanced CSS with new classes for modal components
- Responsive grid layouts for different screen sizes
- Consistent styling with existing admin theme

## Testing
- ✅ All API endpoints tested and working
- ✅ CRUD operations functional
- ✅ Authentication and authorization working
- ✅ Error handling tested
- ✅ CSV export functionality verified

## Usage Instructions

### For Admins
1. **Access**: Navigate to `/admin/users` in the admin dashboard
2. **Add User**: Click "Add New User" button and fill the form
3. **Manage Roles**: Use the role dropdown to change user roles
4. **Toggle Status**: Click the status button to activate/deactivate users
5. **Delete Users**: Click the delete button and confirm
6. **Search**: Use the search box to find specific users
7. **Filter**: Use dropdowns to filter by role or status
8. **Export**: Click "Export" to download user data as CSV

### Security Notes
- Only admin users can access user management features
